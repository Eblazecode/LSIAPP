                                    I saw an amazing changes.my boys could get home and attend to his
                                    home task without been forced to,my older kids make out time to read
                                    his note,honestly it was like a magic.Before the end of term my little

                                    in figure 1- 1200 and so on.He takes responsibility to pick up his book,

                                    I saw transformation in one week,I am also a professional teacher
                                    with the government.when I brought him to J.s.s1 in my heart I was
                                    just praying for the best for him but to my greatest surprise,in
                                    one week his dressing and maintainance of uniform has changed,i was
                                    impressed.secondly in his academics,he did not have the habit of settling
                                    down to read,very restless a child but Luci schools restructured his
                                    life at he started reading his note after dinner till he became grounded
                                    in in to the eetent that he ask to put up an alam to wake him up by 4am to read more.
                                    it was a shock to me and very encouraging,God bless Lucie Schools</p>

                                    is Lucie High School and in three years he can read musicard note
                                    and interprete correctly and can play piano very well.when I came
                                    into the school I was told my child will have to buy any instrument of his choice and at least he will know how to play two instrument before finishing his condary education I thought it will be impossible becos teaching music and involving normal academics could be difficult,but I now realize that music help them in their studies to concentrate and now in three years he has been playing piano like no body' business and he is picking up giuter now,
                                    thanks to the management of Lucie School for this great idea</p>
