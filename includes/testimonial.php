                            through a referee and I was actually scared because my kids has been to
                            several school but could not get what I want for my kids but when I
                            came I let the school know my fears,but to my surprise in three weeks
                            I saw an amazing changes.my boys could get home and attend to his
                            home task without been forced to,my older kids make out time to read
                            his note,honestly it was like a magic.Before the end of term my little
                            boy in Nursery 2 has been able to understand and write 1-100,
                            in figure 1- 1200 and so on.He takes responsibility to pick up his book,
                            it is a great relive
                            for me as a parent,not dragging a child to attempt assignment</p>

                            I saw transformation in one week,I am also a professional teacher
                            with the government.when I brought him to J.s.s1 in my heart I was
                            just praying for the best for him but to my greatest surprise,in
                            one week his dressing and maintainance of uniform has changed,i was
                            impressed.secondly in his academics,he did not have the habit of settling
                            down to read,very restless a child but Luci schools restructured his
                            life at he started reading his note after dinner till he became grounded
                            in in to the eaten that he ask to put up an Alarm to wake him up by 4am to read more.
                            it was a shock to me and very encouraging,God bless Lucie Schools</p>

                        <p class=" text-black">My child joined the secondary arm which
                            is Lucie High School and in three years he can read musicard note
                            and inteprete correctly and can play piano very well.when I came
                            into the school I was told my child will have to buy any instrument of his choice
                            and at least he will know how to play two instrument before finishing his
                            condary education I thought it will be impossible becos teaching music
                            and involving normal academics could be difficult,but I now realize
                            that music help them in their studies to concentrate and now in three
                            years he has been playing piano like no body' business and he is
                            picking up giuter now,
                            thanks to the management of Lucie School for this great idea</p>
